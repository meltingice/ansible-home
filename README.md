A collection of Ansible roles that I use on my home servers.

Not every one of these is truly generic. In other words, there may be a few things specific to my home setup that will need to be tweaked for you. Feel free to copy and learn from them though, or use them verbatim when possible.

These roles are designed with Ubuntu in mind. They may or may not work on other Debian based systems.
