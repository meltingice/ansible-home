# Plex

This will install Plex using an auto-update script. This means that every time this role runs, it will check for a new version of Plex and auto-update it. Takes the hassle away, especially on Linux where there is no auto-update feature built into Plex yet.

## NFS Mounts

There are 3 NFS mounts in the main task that are specific to my home setup. Please remove or edit before using the role, or else you will definitely encounter errors.
